- Manage repository-specific notifications
- Control repository notification settings (all activity, default, or mute)

## Prerequisites

- Bun 1.0 or higher (or Node.js 18+ as fallback)
- GitHub Personal Access Token (classic) with `notifications` or `repo` scope

## Installation

1. Clone this repository
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/github-notifications-mcp-server.git

   ```

2. Install dependencies

   ```

## Usage

### Running the server directly

```

## Example Prompts

Here are some example prompts you can use with Claude Desktop once the server is connected:

- "Can you check my GitHub notifications?"
- "Show me my unread notifications from the last 24 hours."
- "Mark all my notifications as read."
- "Can you tell me about notification thread 12345?"
- "Unsubscribe me from thread 12345."
- "What notifications do I have for the octocat/Hello-World repository?"
- "Mark all notifications from the octocat/Hello-World repository as read."
- "Watch all activity on the octocat/Hello-World repository."
- "Set the octocat/Hello-World repository to default settings (participating and @mentions)."
- "Check my notification settings for the octocat/Hello-World repository."
- "Mute all notifications from the octocat/Hello-World repository."

## Development

### URL Handling

This server automatically converts GitHub API URLs to their corresponding web UI URLs. For example:

- API URL: `https://api.github.com/repos/nodejs/node/pulls/57557`
- Converted to: `https://github.com/nodejs/node/pull/57557`

The conversion handles:
- Domain conversion from `api.github.com/repos` to `github.com`
- Path correction for pull requests (changing `pulls` to `pull`)
- Preservation of additional path segments
